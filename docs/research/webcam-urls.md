## TECHNICAL NOTES & RECOMMENDATIONS

### Best Candidates for MVP (Based on Reliability & Quality):
1. **Bondi Beach** - Multiple high-quality sources, dedicated SLSC cameras
2. **Manly Beach** - Excellent hotel-based camera, multiple backups
3. **Maroubra Beach** - Council + third-party sources, good redundancy
4. **Cronulla/Wanda** - SLSC-based camera, reliable surf cam infrastructure
5. **Palm Beach** - Dedicated SLSC camera, good quality

### Considerations:
- **Randwick Council cams** (Coogee, Maroubra, Clovelly, Little Bay, Yarra Bay) may experience downtime due to weather/vandalism
- **Subscription services** (Swellnet) may require paid access for full quality
- **Surfline** cameras are reliable but may have licensing restrictions
- **SLSC cameras** (Bondi, North Bondi, Palm Beach) are highly reliable and publicly accessible
- **Hotel/commercial cameras** (Manly Pacific) are stable and well-maintained

### Update Frequencies:
- **Live streaming:** Bondi (multiple), Manly, Maroubra (Brasurf), Cronulla
- **Regular updates (1-10 min intervals):** Most Surfline, Randwick Council, SpotCameras
- **Variable:** Third-party aggregators

### Image Quality:
- **High:** SLSC cameras, Swellnet, major Surfline locations
- **Medium-High:** Most commercial/hotel cameras, Surfline secondary locations
- **Medium:** Council cameras (weather-dependent), aggregator sites

### Scraping Considerations:
- Need to test each URL for actual image/stream access
- Some may require API keys or subscriptions
- Council cameras may have direct image URLs available
- Consider robots.txt and terms of service for each source
- May need Playwright for JavaScript-rendered streams
