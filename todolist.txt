[X] Set up Cloudflare R2 bucket for image storage - COMPLETED 2026-01-23
[x] Store 1 week of test data

### Week 3-4: Computer Vision & Backend
[x] Integrate YOLOv8 for person detection
[x] Calculate busyness score algorithm (0-100 based on beach area)
[X] Implement fallback pixel density analysis - COMPLETED 2026-01-23
[x] Store data in Cloudflare D1 (SQLite) + R2 (images)
[x] Set up Cloudflare Workers for API
[x] Implement Hono routing for edge-native API
[X] Create API endpoint: GET /api/beaches (list all monitored beaches) - COMPLETED 2026-01-23
[ ] Create API endpoint: GET /api/beaches/:id/current (current busyness)
[ ] Create API endpoint: GET /api/beaches/:id/history?range=7d (historical data)
[ ] Create API endpoint: GET /api/beaches/compare?ids=bondi,manly (compare beaches)

### Week 5-6: Frontend (SvelteKit + shadcn-svelte)
[ ] Initialize SvelteKit project
[ ] Set up shadcn-svelte component library
[ ] Configure Tailwind CSS
[ ] Build Home page: Map of Sydney beaches with color-coded busyness
[ ] Build Beach Detail page: Live webcam + graph + predictions
[ ] Build Compare page: Side-by-side comparison
[ ] Implement beach list with shadcn-svelte components
[ ] Show live busyness score + last captured image
[ ] Display 7-day historical graph (Chart.js or D3.js)
[ ] Implement busyness badge component (Quiet / Moderate / Busy / Very Busy)
[ ] Make design mobile-responsive
[ ] Deploy to Cloudflare Pages
[ ] Test end-to-end: scraper → analysis → API → frontend

### Week 5-6: Automation
[ ] Set up Cloudflare Workers Cron for scheduled tasks
[ ] Implement cron: Every 10 minutes - scrape webcams → analyze → store
[ ] Implement cron: Every hour - update predictions based on patterns
[ ] Implement cron: Daily - clean up old images (keep only samples)

### MVP Launch Checklist
[ ] Verify 5 beaches are monitored
[ ] Verify live busyness score updates every 10 minutes
[ ] Verify 7-day historical data is visible
[ ] Verify mobile-responsive design works on iOS/Android
[ ] Soft launch to 50 beta users (friends, family, surf community)
[ ] Collect feedback on accuracy and UX

## PHASE 2: Enhanced Intelligence (Weeks 7-12)
[ ] Integrate weather API (sunny days = busier)
[ ] Correlate with tide data
[ ] Implement school holiday detection (crowd spikes)
[ ] Train machine learning model to predict future busyness
[ ] Add 10 more beaches to monitoring
[ ] Implement "Best Time" predictor: "Typically quiet Mon-Fri before 10am"
[ ] Add seasonal trends display (Summer vs Winter patterns)

## PHASE 3: Community & Alerts (Weeks 13-18)
[ ] Build user authentication system
[ ] Create user accounts feature
[ ] Implement push notification infrastructure
[ ] Build "Notify Me When Quiet" alert feature
[ ] Build daily digest email: "Best beach to visit today"
[ ] Add user-submitted crowd reports (crowdsourced validation)
[ ] Implement beach favorites/watchlist feature
[ ] Build user profile page

## PHASE 4: Monetization (Weeks 19-24)
[ ] Design premium tier features ($4.99/month or $39/year)
[ ] Unlock all beaches (20+) for premium users
[ ] Implement premium push notifications
[ ] Add 30-day historical data view for premium
[ ] Create ad-free experience toggle
[ ] Build "Best time" advanced predictions for premium
[ ] Design B2B/API access tier ($299/month)
[ ] Create council dashboards for resource planning
[ ] Build tourism board visitor insights dashboard
[ ] Implement API access for surf schools
[ ] Set up advertising infrastructure (if pursuing)
[ ] Create sponsored beaches feature

## TECHNICAL DEBT & OPTIMIZATION
[ ] Optimize YOLOv8 model per beach (custom training for different camera angles)
[ ] Implement comprehensive error handling for webcam failures
[ ] Add monitoring and alerting for system uptime
[ ] Optimize Cloudflare Workers performance
[ ] Implement caching strategy for API responses
[ ] Add unit tests for busyness score calculation
[ ] Add integration tests for API endpoints
[ ] Add E2E tests for critical user flows
[ ] Document API endpoints (OpenAPI spec)
[ ] Create developer documentation

## RESEARCH & VALIDATION
[ ] Validate ML accuracy target (80%+ correct predictions)
[ ] Measure latency: webcam capture to data visible (target <2 minutes)
[ ] Track uptime: % of time data is fresh (target 95%+)
[ ] Define busyness thresholds (busy vs quiet - absolute count or % capacity?)
[ ] Establish relationships with councils for official API access
[ ] Research privacy policy requirements
[ ] Finalize brand name (BeachWatch, CrowdCast, QuietBeach, BeachRadar?)

## OPEN QUESTIONS TO RESOLVE
[ ] Which 5 beaches for MVP? (Bondi, Manly, Coogee, Bronte, Maroubra? Or diversify regions?)
[ ] What counts as "busy" vs "quiet"? (Absolute count or % of beach capacity?)
[ ] How do we verify ML accuracy? (Crowdsource reports?)
[ ] Final brand name decision?

## SUCCESS METRICS TO TRACK
[ ] Set up analytics dashboard
[ ] Track Daily Active Users (DAU) - Target: 500 users Month 1, 2,000 by Month 3
[ ] Track return rate (% users return within 7 days) - Target: 40%+
[ ] Track session duration - Target: 2-3 minutes
[ ] Monitor cost per beach - Target: <$10/month per beach
[ ] Track accuracy of busyness predictions
[ ] Monitor API latency and uptime
